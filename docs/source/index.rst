Welcome to Django Mail Queue's documentation!
=============================================

Mail Queue is a new way to send and keep track of email in your Django application.  Mail queue stores each email you send 
and records success/failure.  You can requeue up un-sent mail and review the mail generated by your app.  Mail Queue is hosted
at https://github.com/dstegelman/django-mail-queue
